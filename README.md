# Sandwich Club Project

## Project Overview
I completed this project as a part of Udacity Android Nanodegree program. **Sandwich Club** app
shows the details of each sandwich once it is selected.

## Why this Project
Building a layout and populating its fields from data received as JSON
is a common task for Android Developers. Although JSON parsing is usually
done using libraries, writing the JSON parsing for this project
helped me to better understand how it is processed.

## What I Learned
Through this project, I learned:
- Practice JSON parsing to a model object
- Design an activity layout
- Populate all fields in the layout accordingly
